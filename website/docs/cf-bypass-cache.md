# Cloudflare Bypass Cache Rules

This project provides a collection of ready-to-use Cloudflare cache bypass rules for popular web frameworks. These rules help ensure dynamic content (such as admin areas, authenticated users, and comment authors) is always served fresh, bypassing Cloudflare's cache when necessary.

## Rule Sets Available

- **WordPress**
- **Laravel**
- **ASP.NET**
- **Generic web apps**

Each rule is documented and copy-paste friendly for Cloudflare's expression builder.

## Quick Start

No installation required. Simply copy the desired rule set from the documentation and paste it into your Cloudflare dashboard.
